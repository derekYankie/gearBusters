Gear Buster's
-------------
A website designed to allow fisher's to input the location and name of their ghost gear.User input is quite basic and is made up of a simple submit form. All points are saved and marked with the latitude and longitude along with the name of the ghost gear.

Why?
-------------
The site was made as a submission for #codeforfish also known as the Fishackathon!

The Problem Given!
-------------
The problem we were given to solve, was a way to allow fisherman to mark and notify others of their lost "ghost" gear. After some thought we came up with the idea of Gear Buster's.
The site allows fisherman to upload a photo, name of the lost gear, along with the geolocation of it. After the information is submitted, a pinpoint of that location will popup along with the given information allowing other fisherman to be wary.
